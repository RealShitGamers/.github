Here at RealShitGamers we take pride in all of our game development experience. From GG, the terrible HTML5 export of a GameMaker game that only works properly when run as an executable, to Waifu Hunter 2077, a multiplayer shooter built in Unity riddled with bugs and learning experiences. Every game listed here is a testament to growing and learning game design and software engineering. We don't make good games - we make some real shit.

Summary: Every developer has to make an "RPG" of some sort and fail. It's tradition. The game's speed is sync'd with frame rate so good luck 144Hz monitor users! The enemies are bland and the level design is poor at best. But I planned a game, designed some fun bosses, used an asset pack for art, and made a complete product that "works." I drew all of the levels out in my notebook, created flow charts for the boss AI, and designed a basic stat and spell system. This is one of my favorite game development experiences ever because of the hard work I put into it and the satisfying feeling of completing this project. It doesn't matter if it came out good or not because of the lessons I learned and experience I gained.

Summary: The first video game I ever made. Platformer/puzzle game. Made in GameMaker and shared to my friends as a .exe file that definitely looked like a virus. Later exported via HTML5 with little understanding and now you can't run backwards. What a quick lesson learned in porting!
